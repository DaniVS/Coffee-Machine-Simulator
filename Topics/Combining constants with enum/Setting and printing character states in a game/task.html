<h2>Setting and printing character states in a game</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<div class="alert alert-warning">Hey there! This problem might be a bit unpredictable, but give it a go and let us know how you do!</div>In a programming game you are working on, there is a character class that has an enum for the different states the character can be in. These states are: NORMAL, POWERED_UP, WEAKENED, and INVISIBLE. If the selectState function is called with a number as argument (0 for NORMAL, 1 for POWERED_UP, 2 for WEAKENED, 3 for INVISIBLE), please write the switch statement within the selectState function that assigns the correct state to the character, as well as an enum for these states. Also implement a method in your Character class that can print the current character's state. If the state value input is not within the range 0-3, set the character's state to NORMAL. Input will be an integer between 0 and 5, representing the state to be set for the character. The output is the state the character ends up in, returned as a string.<br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">2<br></code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">WEAKENED<br></code></pre><br><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">4<br></code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">NORMAL<br></code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 5 seconds</font><br><br>
